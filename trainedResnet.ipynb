    "A neural network consists of several layers. Each layer takes an input array, computes a linear product, applies some non linear activation function to give an output. These inputs and outputs are just n-dimensional arrays, and are called as `Tensor`s in PyTorch. These are similar to what we have in `NumPy` except that `Tensor`s can run on GPUs. PyTorch provides several functions for operating on these `Tensor`s. In the background, during forward and backward propagation, `Tensor`s can keep track of the computational graph and its weights' gradients. "

    "However, this approach (of calling the network on the input tensor to get its output) doesn't scale well. Typically, during the training phase, one would shuffle all the images in a dataset, load a batch of images from the shuffle, preprocess all the images in that batch (by applying some transformations such as random cropping, rescaling the image, etc.), and then provide the resulting image tensor to the model. If we simply do all these operations by iterating over the dataset using a `for` loop, these operations can turn out to be inefficient, especially when working on large datasets. For every batch, we have to generate the input tensor, and only after this step is complete, the network will be able to compute the output on this tensor.\n",

In other words, the training process doesn't need to wait for the worker threads to fetch the batch for training. Furthermore, this is necessary because loading all the images in a dataset into memory and then processing them may not always be feasible because of memory constraints.\n",
